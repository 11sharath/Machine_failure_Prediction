PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE FOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT

Statement:

Manufacturing companies face significant downtime costs when machinery unexpectedly fails. Current maintenance is often reactive or scheduled without considering actual wear and tear, 
leading to either unnecessary servicing or sudden breakdowns. The challenge is to predict when a machine is likely to fail using sensor data so that maintenance can be done proactively.
Description:

Using historical sensor readings (temperature, vibration, pressure, etc.), operational logs, and failure records,
build a predictive model that estimates the remaining useful life (RUL) of equipment. The model should detect early warning signs of failure and trigger alerts for preventive maintenance. This would reduce downtime, improve productivity, and save costs.
